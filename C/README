INTRODUCTION:

Inline::C - Write Perl subroutines in C.

Inline::C is the Inline Language Support Module (ILSM) for C

Example:

    use Inline C => <<'END';
    SV* JAxH(char* x) {
        return newSVpvf ("Just Another %s Hacker",x);
    }
    END
    
    print JAxH('Inline'), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

    Just Another Inline Hacker

FEATURES:

Inline::C version 0.30 is a major upgrade from previous verions. It includes:

+ Integrated support for typemap files in C.
  + All the recognized types now come *only* from typemaps. 
  + The default types come from the default typemap installed with core Perl.
  + Typemaps are used to modify the Parse::RecDescent grammar for parsing C.
+ Inline::C completely separated from base Inline code.
+ Inline::C is now beta status
+ Inline::C::grammar is a separate module
+ Much easier and more powerful configuration syntax.
+ More XS and MakeMaker features exposed for configuration.
+ Support for using Inline 'with' Event.pm for C callbacks.
+ More documentation
  + perldoc Inline::C
  + perldoc Inline::C-Cookbook
+ Better error messages and easier debugging.

Other features of Inline::C include:

= Support for Perl Stack Handling
= Works on all Unix and MS Windows configurations.

INSTALLATION:

This module requires the Inline module with which it is distributed. It also
requires the appropriate C compiler. (Where appropriate means the one referred
to in your Config.pm) 

Inline::C is packaged with Inline.pm. It is not necessary to install Inline::C to use Inline with some other language, like Java.
