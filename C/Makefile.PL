Inline::C is packaged with Inline.pm because it is the most commonly used
Inline Language Support Module (ILSM).

See also: Inline::ASM, ::Awk, ::BC, ::Basic, ::Befunge, ::CPP (C++), ::CPR,
          ::Foo, ::Guile, ::Java, ::Octave, ::PERL, ::Python, ::Ruby, ::TT,
          ::Tcl and ::WebChat.

Config.pm indicates that your version of Perl was built with this C compiler:

    $cc

END

if ($found) {
    print <<END;
I have located this compiler on your system.

END
}
else {
    print <<END;
I cannot locate this compiler on your system.

You can install Inline.pm without installing Inline::C. But you'll
need to install another Inline language module (like Inline::Java for
instance) to actually make use of it.

If the aforementioned C compiler really is on your system, please make sure
it can be found in the PATH and then try running this program again. Or if
you think I made an error searching for this compiler, simply answer 'Y' to
the next question.
