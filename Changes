Revision history for Perl extension Inline.

0.30  Thu Sep 14 20:51:11 PDT 2000
	- localize $/ and $\ to shield them from things like 'perl -l'.
	Thanks Michael Schwern.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 10:07:33 PDT 2000
	- Use MD5 on unmodified code only. User must force recompile if 
	auto_headers change. This would have caused existing installs to break.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 10:04:14 PDT 2000
	- Don't determine build path unless really needed, since a blib_I might
	be created. This might be annoying for someone who is only *using* an
	Inline extension module.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 08:35:53 PDT 2000
        - Mangle $VERSION into object name for modules

0.25  Thu Aug 31 22:46:25 PDT 2000
	- Support Inline->import(C=><DATA>); syntax

0.25  Sun Aug 20 20:52:24 PDT 2000
	- Return an empty list when the C function is of type void and doesn't
	use any stack manipulating macros. (ie dXSARGS) It used to return 
	whatever was passed in on the stack. :-(

0.25  Fri Aug 18 18:45:24 PDT 2000
	- Force rebuild when SITE_INSTALL option is set.

0.25  Fri Aug 18 18:15:34 PDT 2000
	- Figured out what was actually causing the 0.23 AutoLoader bug.
	Can't autoload from "./blib" (relative path) when chdir() has been
	used. Fixed properly now. Can AutoLoad fix_make() again. :-)

0.24  Fri Aug 18 03:03:06 PDT 2000
	- Fixed Autoload bug found during "make test" of Inline installation.

0.23  Wed Aug 16 18:10:07 PDT 2000
        - Added support for MSWin32 operating systems which use the Microsoft 
	Visual C++ compiler.

0.22  Wed Aug  9 18:55:54 PDT 2000
	- First alpha release to CPAN

0.01  Mon Jul 24 11:23:25 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
