	  Put hack in INIT block to fix Sarathy's patch ;)

0.41  Sat Jun  2 19:53:58 PDT 2001

	  Added alpha support for Inline::Files
	  Made all internal path names canonical

0.40  Sun May 13 23:38:26 PDT 2001
	- Finished TRIAL1 version of Inline-0.40
	  Short object names
          Safer config generation
          AUTONAME support
          Reinstituted AutoLoading
          Put all messages into subroutines inside Inline.pm

0.40  Wed May  9 11:14:47 PDT 2001
	- Completely reorganized the Inline internal object into major groups:
	  API - Contract space for the ILSMs. Guaranteed backwards compatible
	        after Inline 1.00.
	  ILSM - Private space for ILSMs
	  INLINE - Private Inline space. Subject to constant change.
	  CONFIG - Config options. Not for use by ILSMs
	  MATCH - Matching criteria for the object.
	  STRUCT - Reserved for Inline::Struct	  

0.40  Wed May  9 11:14:47 PDT 2001
	- Added command proxy logic for Inline::MakeMaker utilities:
	  INSTALL, MAKEDIST, MAKEPPD

	- Got _INSTALL_ option working with Inline::MakeMaker

0.40  Sun Apr 29 13:58:40 PDT 2001
	- Replaced Inline's use of Data::Dumper with Inline::Denter.
 	  This is a stripped down version of Data::Denter. This change
	  makes Inline more secure because it doesn't need to eval()
	  untrusted code. Also removes the dependency on Safe.pm which has
	  known security flaws. Yay!

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
	- 'require FindBin' instead of 'use FindBin' for mod_perl.

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001

	- Changed 'make install' to 'make pure_install'

	- Rearranged test harness. Removed dependency on C for tests.
	  Invented Inline::Foo for testing.

	- Fixed MSWin32 bug of getting full path parts in dll name.

0.32  Thu Feb 22 02:35:04 PST 2001

	- Shortened install path to .Inline/lib/auto/...
        - Lengthened the build path to .Inline/build/...

0.31  Sat Jan 13 11:18:22 PST 2001
	- Changed BLIB option to DIRECTORY
	- Changed default DIRECTORY from blib_I to _Inline or .Inline

0.30  Fri Dec  8 02:00:17 PST 2000
	- Major reworking of Inline.pm
	Sweeping changes to:
	- Configuaration
	- Syntax
	- Language integration
	Too much to list here. See ToDo

0.26  Thu Sep 14 20:51:11 PDT 2000
	- localize $/ and $\ to shield them from things like 'perl -l'.
	Thanks Michael Schwern.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 10:07:33 PDT 2000
	- Use MD5 on unmodified code only. User must force recompile if 
	auto_headers change. This would have caused existing installs to break.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 10:04:14 PDT 2000
	- Don't determine build path unless really needed, since a blib_I might
	be created. This might be annoying for someone who is only *using* an
	Inline extension module.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 08:35:53 PDT 2000
        - Mangle $VERSION into object name for modules

0.25  Thu Aug 31 22:46:25 PDT 2000
	- Support Inline->import(C=><DATA>); syntax

0.25  Sun Aug 20 20:52:24 PDT 2000
	- Return an empty list when the C function is of type void and doesn't
	use any stack manipulating macros. (ie dXSARGS) It used to return 
	whatever was passed in on the stack. :-(

0.25  Fri Aug 18 18:45:24 PDT 2000
	- Force rebuild when SITE_INSTALL option is set.

0.25  Fri Aug 18 18:15:34 PDT 2000
	- Figured out what was actually causing the 0.23 AutoLoader bug.
	Can't autoload from "./blib" (relative path) when chdir() has been
	used. Fixed properly now. Can AutoLoad fix_make() again. :-)

0.24  Fri Aug 18 03:03:06 PDT 2000
	- Fixed Autoload bug found during "make test" of Inline installation.

0.23  Wed Aug 16 18:10:07 PDT 2000
        - Added support for MSWin32 operating systems which use the Microsoft 
	Visual C++ compiler.

0.22  Wed Aug  9 18:55:54 PDT 2000
	- First alpha release to CPAN
